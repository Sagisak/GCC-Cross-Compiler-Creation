# GCC-Cross-Compiler-Creation
This repository is created to make a Cross-Compiler for future creation of a much larger projects
The initial creation of this project was for making an OS. It was either this or making the barebone instantly. I realise that
I need the tools to help relay communication between some machines. The majority of the references are from this site:

https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page

Some help understanding of terminologies are by searching the internet or asking high-tech AI, like chatGPT, for extra explanation of the
creation.

The goal of this is to make a GCC cross compiler that is portable and only need to be setup just by file script only.

## Setup

To set up the environment for using the cross-compiler, run the following command:

```sh
source ./setup-environment.sh
