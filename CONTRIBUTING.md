#Disclaimer for the people who want to contribute

I'm actually really cool with people contributing, even though is just me following from the website documents. I do have some  regulation
if anybody wants to contribute:

1) First, any contribution please make it into a new branch, not the main branch.
2) Give explanation to any modification or added files. This is just me being curious and really wanted to know the why it is added or modified, where the added or modified file is placed, what is the purpose, and how it can be benefitial (if it is not then it is also fine)

That's it from me, have fun on contributing!
